# luxe — session resume document

## Current state — 2026-05-04

**v1.4.1 fixes shipped + validated**: 18 commits since v1.4.0 (`1e545e8 → 10b352b`). Working tree clean. 461 tests passing.

**`nothing-doc-config × 10` validation: 10/10 PASS** with `LUXE_WRITE_PRESSURE=1` + `LUXE_REPROMPT_ON_DOC=1`. Three rescue regimes:
- 8/10 clean engagement (no rescue)
- 1/10 Mode B mid-loop write-pressure (rep 9 — gate fired at step 6 with 18 tools + 5024 tokens + 0 writes; model wrote 138 lines after injection)
- 1/10 reprompt rescue (rep 5 — Mode B's threshold barely missed at step 5 entry; main pass produced 28k prose chars + 0 writes; reprompt landed and model wrote 147 lines)
- Linter fix held: 0 unresolved citations across all 10 reps
- Historical ~33% FAIL rate on this fixture → 0%

**External agent benchmark adapters scaffolded** (per `~/.claude/plans/fancy-honking-lerdorf.md`):
- BFCL v3 — `benchmarks/bfcl/`: schemas + adapter + grade + run.py + aggregate.py + tests
- SWE-bench Verified — `benchmarks/swebench/`: fixtures + stratify + adapter + run.py (preds-only) + harness.py + compare.py (paired McNemar) + tests
- Frozen subset: `benchmarks/swebench/subsets/v1_baseline_n75.json` (75 instances, 12 repos, per-repo cap 8)

**External benchmark first results** (`acceptance/bfcl/pre_specdd_v141/rep_1/`):
- BFCL `simple_python` raw: 330/400 = **82.5%**
- BFCL `irrelevance` raw: 220/240 = **91.67%**
- Combined: 550/640 = **85.94%**
- 43/70 simple_python failures = `no_tool_call_emitted` — prose-mode tendencies in raw mode too
- ~16-21s/problem at temp=0 (much slower than the plan's 3-5s estimate)

**SWE-bench preds-only smoke** (`acceptance/swebench/smoke_2026_05_04/`):
- 3 astropy instances; 2/3 produced non-empty patches; ~3 min wall/instance
- Pipeline validated end-to-end (clone → agent → diff → predictions.json)
- **Critical finding**: model creates reproducer scripts (`repo_root/test_sep.py`) instead of editing source files. SWE-bench-specific prompting needed before a real n=75 baseline run.

Champion unchanged: `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-6bit` at temperature=0.0 on oMLX.

## ⚡ Resume here — pending decisions

### A. Tag v1.4.1 + decide on Mode B promotion (~5 min)
Three fixes are validated and worth tagging:
- Citation-linter bare-filename fallback (Mode A)
- Mode B mid-loop write-pressure (opt-in via `LUXE_WRITE_PRESSURE=1`)
- Sidecar regrade lint re-run

```bash
git tag -a v1.4.1 -m "v1.4.1: linter bare-filename fix + Mode B opt-in + regrade lint re-run"
```

Decision: promote `LUXE_WRITE_PRESSURE=1` from opt-in to default? 10/10 validation supports it but a bench-wide ×3 reps with the flag would be the rigorous gate before promotion. ~75 min wall.

### B. SWE-bench prompt work before n=75 baseline (~half-day)
The smoke exposed that the agent creates reproducer scripts instead of editing source. Without specialized prompting, an n=75 baseline would mostly score 0%. Two paths:
1. Add a `--task swebench-bugfix` mode in `src/luxe/cli.py` with curated bug-fix prompt ("read suspected source; identify root cause; edit the source file; don't write reproducers; run tests to verify").
2. Skip the SWE-bench prompt work; accept low pass rate; measure the *agent − raw* delta as a proxy for luxe's value-add.

Option 1 is more honest. ~half-day to a session.

### C. Continue BFCL coverage (~3 hours)
Three categories not yet run: `multiple` (200), `parallel` (200), `parallel_multiple` (200). Each ~50-60 min wall. Would round out the Python subset to ~1240 problems for a complete pre-SpecDD baseline.

```bash
OMLX_API_KEY=omlx-sdb25582k3mq8pf9 .venv/bin/python -m benchmarks.bfcl.run \
    --categories multiple parallel parallel_multiple \
    --mode raw \
    --output acceptance/bfcl/pre_specdd_v141/rep_1/ \
    --model Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-6bit --temperature 0.0
.venv/bin/python -m benchmarks.bfcl.aggregate --output acceptance/bfcl/pre_specdd_v141/rep_1/
```

### D. Docker confirmation for SWE-bench harness scoring
`pip install swebench` is done; harness wrapper at `benchmarks/swebench/harness.py` is wired but defers Docker calls. Confirm Docker Desktop is up + ~10GB free + acceptable RAM headroom (model ~30GB + container layer 6-8GB on a 64GB box is tight but viable). Then:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -c "
from pathlib import Path
from benchmarks.swebench.harness import run_harness, write_harness_summary
res = run_harness(Path('acceptance/swebench/smoke_2026_05_04/predictions.json'),
                  output_dir=Path('acceptance/swebench/smoke_2026_05_04/'),
                  run_id='luxe_smoke')
write_harness_summary(res, Path('acceptance/swebench/smoke_2026_05_04/harness_summary.json'))
"
```

### E. Lever 2 prep — `~/.claude/plans/fluffy-brewing-lemur.md`
~2-3 sessions per the SpecDD plan. Decoupled from benchmark work; can parallelize.

### F. Smaller cleanup items
- Retire v1.3 directive reprompt code in `cli.py` (RESUME old option C, ~15 min)
- `min_added_lines` as per-requirement predicate kind in `src/luxe/spec.py`
- `ast_query` and `manual` predicate full integrations (currently stubbed in `spec_validator.py`)
- Tune Mode B thresholds based on broader bench data (currently 10 tools / 4000 tokens / step 5)

## 30-second orientation

**luxe** is an MLX-only repo maintainer for Apple Silicon (oMLX backend on `localhost:8000`). Takes a goal + repo, opens a PR. Mono-only since v1.0 — single model, single agent loop, single `luxe maintain` command. Champion: `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-6bit` in `configs/single_64gb.yaml`.

**What's shipped through v1.4.1**:
- v1.0 — mono-only; 10 fixtures; strict gates
- v1.1 — pinned work_dir default + manage_strict overlay → 9/10
- v1.2 — per-tool subphase pass: cve_lookup gated to manage; bash chain-hardening; read_file binary detection
- v1.3 — read_file dedup exemption + lpe-typing fixture surgery + reprompt-on-doc + `_diff_against_base` fix
- v1.4 — SpecDD Lever 1: programmatic Definition of Done; per-requirement spec validator; reprompt gate uses spec
- v1.4.1 — citation-linter bare-filename fallback (Mode A) + Mode B mid-loop write-pressure (opt-in) + sidecar regrade lint re-run

**What's queued**:
- v1.5.0 — SpecDD Lever 2 (`.sdd` parser, spec_resolver, tool-side Forbids, resume path, prompt injection)
- v1.6.0 — SpecDD Lever 3 (fixture-side `.sdd` contracts, methodology A/B)
- External benchmark baseline run (BFCL multiple/parallel + SWE-bench n=75 with curated prompt)

**Iteration model**: bench changes go through `scripts/regrade_local.py` for fast iteration on grader/linter logic without re-running luxe. Full bench re-runs reserved for end-of-phase confirmation.

---

## The bench-as-truth pattern

Every model claim goes through:

1. Run `python -m benchmarks.maintain_suite.run --variants <yaml>`.
2. Read the printed comparison table — `pass/fail/wall/tokens/bailouts` per cell.
3. **Inspect every PASS PR by hand** via the actual local-branch ref in the offline cache: `git -C ~/.luxe/fixture-cache/<repo> diff <base_sha>..<branch_name>`. **Do NOT use `origin/<branch>`** — the cache's stale GitHub-tracking refs point to old runs and silently mislead. Branch name is in `~/.luxe/runs/<run_id>/pr_state.json`.
4. Sidecar regrade with `scripts/regrade_local.py --output <dir>` for fast, faithful re-grading without re-running luxe (seconds vs 60-120 min). As of v1.4.1, re-runs the citation linter against the original synthesizer.md.

Real PASS count is always ≤ printed count. Every historical bake-off has had at least one false-positive PASS.

## oMLX configuration

`~/.omlx/settings.json`:
```json
"max_model_memory": "36GB",
"idle_timeout": { "idle_timeout_seconds": 1800 }
```

System-level Metal wired ceiling — kept aligned with `max_model_memory`:
```bash
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=36864
echo "iogpu.wired_limit_mb=36864" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

API key for HTTP requests: `export OMLX_API_KEY=omlx-sdb25582k3mq8pf9` (in user's shell init; the bench harness reads it).

**Restart oMLX** any time `settings.json`, `model_settings.json`, or new symlinks land: `brew services restart omlx`.

---

## Trace instrumentation

`LUXE_LOG_TOOL_CALLS=1` emits per-tool-call and per-step events to the run's `events.jsonl`. Permanent debugging knob (off by default, zero overhead when off):

```bash
LUXE_LOG_TOOL_CALLS=1 python -m benchmarks.maintain_suite.run --id <fixture> --force
RUN=$(jq -r .luxe_run_id acceptance/<output>/.../state.json)
jq -c 'select(.kind=="tool_call" or .kind=="tool_step_done")' ~/.luxe/runs/$RUN/events.jsonl
```

Mode B fix events (when `LUXE_WRITE_PRESSURE=1`):
```bash
jq -c 'select(.kind=="write_pressure_fired")' ~/.luxe/runs/$RUN/events.jsonl
```

---

## Critical gotchas

- **`oMLX` `idle_timeout: null` keeps models resident forever.** Set to `1800`.
- **`luxe maintain` post-run unload fires by default.** Bench mode uses `--keep-loaded` (already passed by `_luxe_maintain` in `run.py`).
- **At temp=0 the variance collapses to deterministic vectors** (probe_a == probe_b across all 10 fixtures on 2026-05-01 PM). Master plan's "±1 deltas are noise" rule applied at temp=0.2; at temp=0 a 1-fixture delta IS the signal.
- **Offline mode caps every fixture at 4/5** — `gh pr create` always fails (no GitHub remote), so `pr_opened` (1pt of 5) never fires offline. Every PASS reads as 4/5; gate math (≥8 fixtures with score ≥4) still works correctly.
- **`origin/<branch>` in offline-cache repos is a stale-ref trap** — post-2026-05-01 runs push to local branches (`refs/heads/...`) which do NOT update remote-tracking refs. Use `git diff base..<branch>` (local ref) or sidecar regrade.
- **Dense >30B mxfp8 doesn't fit on 64GB Mac under load** — granite-4.1-30b-mxfp8 spiked 22GB+ wired and pushed system into swap. MoE models (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B at ~3B active) run comfortably; dense models don't.
- **`stuck_after_done` doesn't always mean failure** — Qwen3.6-35B-A3B often ships a real diff then trips the stuck-loop detector on cleanup. Distinguishes from `stuck_no_output` (never engaged).
- **`run.py` resume model treats `status: error` as `skip_done` by default** — if a sweep dies before any model invocation, re-launching without `--retry-errors` silently skips every fixture and prints a zeroed Summary. Either pass `--retry-errors` or `rm -rf` the output dir.

## When in doubt

`git log --oneline -20` tells the trajectory. `lessons.md` has postmortems of every failure pattern. The user prefers terse, action-oriented responses — don't summarize what they can read; tell them the next step.

The user is comfortable with auto mode but draws hard lines on destructive shared-system actions (oMLX config, sudo, force-push, deletes outside their workspace). When in doubt, write the change but ask before applying. Do NOT push to remote unless explicitly asked.
